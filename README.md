it plays a crucial role in ensuring safety and security in urban environments. However, 
the maintenance and monitoring of these lamps can be challenging, especially in 
large cities with extensive street networks. In this project, we propose an 
autonomous street lamp fault detection system leveraging machine learning 
techniques to identify and classify various faults in street Street lamps lamps. 
The system consists of a network of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors installed on 
street lamps, capable of collecting data related to luminosity, power consumption, 
and other relevant parameters. This data is transmitted to a central server where it is 
processed using machine learning algorithms for fault detection. 
We employ supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines 
(SVM), Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify 
different types of faults including bulb failure, power supply issues, and sensor 
malfunction. The system is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of 
various fault scenarios to enable accurate fault detection. 
Furthermore, the system incorporates real-time monitoring capabilities, enabling it 
to detect and report faults as they occur. Alerts are sent to maintenance personnel or 
relevant authorities via mobile applications or web interfaces, allowing for prompt 
action to rectify the detected faults. 
The proposed autonomous street lamp fault detection system offers several 
advantages, including improved maintenance efficiency, reduced downtime, and 
enhanced safety in urban areas. By leveraging machine learning and IoT 
technologies, this system represents a significant step towards creating smart and 
sustainable urban environments.
